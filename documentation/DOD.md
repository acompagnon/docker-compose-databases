# Document-oriented database

## Definition

```txt
A document-oriented database, or document store, is a computer program and data
storage system designed for storing, retrieving and managing document-oriented
information, also known as semi-structured data.
Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL databases.

Document-oriented databases are inherently a subclass of the key-value store, another NoSQL database concept.
