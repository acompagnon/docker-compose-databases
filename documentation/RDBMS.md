# Relational Database Management System  - RDBMS

## Origin

The term "relational database" was first in 1970.
E. F. Codd, a computer scientist at IBM introduced the term in his research paper ["A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks"](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf).

## Definition

```txt
A relational database (RDB) is a way of structuring information in tables, rows, and columns.
An RDB has the ability to establish links—or relationships–between information by joining tables,
which makes it easy to understand and gain insights about the relationship between various data points.
